# Solarized theme for the Hyper terminal

Surprisingly, I was unable to find a Solarized theme for Hyper, so I made my own.

# Installation

## Hyper package manager
```
$ hyper i hyper-solarized-patched
```

## Manually
Add `'hyper-solarized-patched'` to your `plugins` array in the `~/.hyper.js` config file

# Configuration

Change to the light variant by adding
```js
solarized: {
    'light': true
}
```

to the `config` section of your `.hyper.js` file
