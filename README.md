# Solarized theme for the Hyper terminal

Surprisingly, I was unable to find a Solarized theme for Hyper, so I made my own.

Not on npm, so install by adding to the `~/.hyper_plugins/local/` directory and adding it to your `.hyper.js` `localPlugins`

Change to the light variant by adding
```js
solarized: {
    'light': true
}
```

to the `config` section of your `.hyper.js` file
